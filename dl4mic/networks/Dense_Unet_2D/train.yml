user_parameters:
- name: name
  display: Name
  value: turgomap_Denseunet2D_model_4_128
  type: string
  default: new_unet2D_model
  help: The name of the model. The model will be saved in a folder with this name. Using the name of an existing model will overwrite the data
- name: baseDir
  display: Base Directory
  value: ../../models
  type: directory
  default: ../../models
  help: The base-folder under which the trained model will be saved.
- name: dataSourcePath
  display: Path to the Source Data
  value: ../../unet-data/training_source
  type: directory
  default: ../../unet-data/training/source
  help: The path to the folder containing the input images on which the model will be trained.
- name: dataTargetPath
  display: Path to the Target Data
  value: ../../unet-data/training_gt
  type: directory
  default: ../../unet-data/training/target
  help: The path to the folder containing the gt-masks on which the model will be trained.
- name: epochs
  display: Epochs
  value: 200
  type: int
  default: 200
  help: The number of epochs the network will be trained.
- name: patchSizeXY
  display: Patch Size XY
  value: 128
  type: int
  default: 512
  help: The image is divided into patches for training. Input the size of the patches (length of a side). Larger patches than 512x512 should NOT be selected for network stability.
advanced_parameters:
- name: stepsPerEpoch
  display: Steps Per Epoch
  value: 0
  type: int
  default: 0
  help: Define the number of training steps by epoch. By default this parameter is calculated so that each image / patch is seen at least once per epoch. Enter 0 to use number_of_patches / batch_size.
- name: batchSize
  display: Batch Size
  value: 1
  type: int
  default: 4
  help: This parameter describes the amount of images that are loaded into the network per step. Smaller batchsizes may improve training performance slightly but may increase training time. If the notebook crashes while loading the dataset this can be due to a too large batch size. Decrease the number in this case.
- name: validationFraction
  display: Validation Fraction
  value: 12
  type: float
  default: 10.0
  help: The fraction of your training dataset in percent, you want to use to validate the network during the training.
- name: learningRate
  display: Initial Learning Rate
  value: 0.00015
  type: float
  default: 0.001
  help: The initial learning rate. The learning rate controls how much the weights of the network with are adjusted with respect to the loss gradient.
internal_network_parameters:
- name: poolingSteps
  display: Pooling Steps
  value: 4
  type: int
  default: 2
  help: Choosing a different number of pooling layers can affect the performance of the network. Each additional pooling step will also add two additional convolutions. The network can learn more complex information but is also more likely to overfit. Achieving best performance may require testing different values here.
data_augmentation:
- name: useDataAugmentation
  display: Use Data Augmentation
  value: True
  type: bool
  default: True
  help: Data augmentation can improve training progress by amplifying differences in the dataset. This can be useful if the available dataset is small since, in this case, it is possible that a network could quickly learn every example in the dataset (overfitting), without augmentation. Augmentation is not necessary for training and if the dataset is large the values can be set to False.
- name: horizontalShift
  display: Horizontal Shift
  value: 100
  type: int
  default: 10
  help: shift images horizontally up to the given percentage of the image width
- name: verticalShift
  display: Vertical Shift
  value: 200
  type: int
  default: 20
  help: shift images vertically up to the given percentage of the image height
- name: zoomRange
  display: Zoom Range
  value: 2
  type: int
  default: 10
  help: apply random zooms in the range [100-zoomRange, 100+zoomRange]
- name: shearRange
  display: Shear Range
  value: 10
  type: int
  default: 10
  help: set the shear intensity (shear angle in counter-clockwise direction in degrees)
- name: horizontalFlip
  display: Horizontal Flip
  value: True
  type: bool
  default: True
  help: use horizontal flips of the image
- name: verticalFlip
  display: Vertical Flip
  value: True
  type: bool
  default: True
  help: use vertical flips of the image
- name: rotationRange
  display: Rotation Range
  value: 90
  type: int
  default: 180
  help: Degree range for random rotations
