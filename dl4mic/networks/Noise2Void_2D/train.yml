user_parameters:
- name: name
  value: test
  type: string
  default: new n2v model
  help: The name of the model. The model will be saved in a folder with this name. Using the name of an existing model will overwrite the data.
- name: baseDir
  value: ../../models
  type: string
  default: ../../models
  help: The base-folder under which the trained model will be saved.
- name: dataPath
  value: ../../n2v-data/training2
  type: string
  default: ../../n2v-data/training
  help: The path to the folder containig the noisy images on which the model will be trained.
- name: epochs
  value: 3
  type: int
  default: 30
  help: The number of epochs the network will be trained.
- name: patchSizeXY
  value: 12
  type: int
  default: 64
  help: The image is divided into patches for training. Input the size of the patches (length of a side). The value should be between 64 and the dimensions of the image and divisible by 8.
advanced_parameters:
- name: stepsPerEpoch
  value: 0
  type: int
  default: 0
  help: Define the number of training steps by epoch. By default this parameter is calculated so that each image / patch is seen at least once per epoch. Enter 0 to use number_of_patches / batch_size.
- name: batchSize
  value: 32
  type: int
  default: 128
  help: This parameter defines the number of patches seen in each training step. Noise2Void requires a large batch size for stable training. Reduce this parameter if your GPU runs out of memory.
- name: validationFraction
  value: 10
  type: float
  default: 10.0
  help: The fraction of your training dataset in percent, you want to use to validate the network during the training.
- name: learningRate
  value: 0.0004
  type: float
  default: 0.0004
  help: The initial learning rate. The learning rate controls how much the weights of the network with are adjusted with respect to the loss gradient.
internal_network_parameters:
- name: netDepth
  value: 2
  type: int
  default: 2
  help: The depth of the U-Net.
- name: netKernelSize
  value: 3
  type: int
  default: 3
  help: The size of conv. kernels in first layer
- name: n2vPercPix
  value: 1.6
  type: float
  default: 1.6
  help: The percentage of pixels to be manipulated by N2V
- name: unetNFirst
  value: 32
  type: int
  default: 32
  help: The number of feature channels in the first u-net layer.
- name: noAugment
  value: True
  type: bool
  default: True
  help: Do not rotate and flip training patches.
